# West Wind DeleteFiles
**Windows utility to delete files and folders recursively, optionally based on a time offset with support for deep file nesting**

This small Console utility deletes files and folders recursively and allows filtering files by date.

* Delete files with simple file specs like `c:\temp\*.*`
* Recursively delete files down the folder hierarchy (-r switch)
* Optionally delete empty folders (-f switch)
* Filter by files to delete based on days or seconds before current time (-d -s)
* Files can be optionally dumped into the Recycle Bin for recoverable deletes (-y)
* Works with deeply nested folder hierarchies (like NPM folders)
* Works a round Windows MAX_PATH limitations
* Portable, single-file EXE file

```

-f          Remove empty [F]olders
-y          Delete to Rec[Y]le Bin (can be slow!)
-l          Trial run - [L]ists items that would be deleted
-q0..2      Quiet mode: -q0 - all (default)  -q1 - No file detail
                        -q2 - No file detail, no summary
-dXX        Number of [D]ays before the current date to delete            
-sXX        Number of [S]econds before the current time to delete

Examples:
---------
DeleteFiles c:\temp\*.* -r -f        - deletes all files in temp folder recursively 
                                       and deletes empty folders
DeleteFiles c:\temp\*.* -r -f -d10   - delete files 10 days or older 
DeleteFiles c:\temp\*.* -r -f -s3600 - delete files older than an hour
DeleteFiles ""c:\My Files\*.*"" -r   - deletes all files in temp folder recursively

### History

##### Version 1.10
*Feb. 28th, 2015*

* **Support for paths longer than MAX_PATH**<br/>
You can now delete deeply nested paths (such as nasty NPM hierarchies). Integrated with [ZetaLongPaths](https://github.com/UweKeim/ZetaLongPaths/) to provide long path support on all directory and file delete operations.

* **Delete ReadOnly, System and Hidden Files**<br/>
Previously read-only files wouldn't delete. This updates now deletes any kind of file regardless of attribute settings. Locked and access denied files still will not work, but everything else will delete.

* **Quiet Mode**<br/>
Add -q0..2 switch to allow quiet operation that runs without showing every file and folder deleted. -q0 shows all - q1 only shows summary, -q2 shows only startup banner.
