# West Wind DeleteFiles
**Windows utility to delete files and folders recursively with support for deep file nesting and optional time offset filtering**

This small Console utility deletes files and folders recursively and allows filtering files by date.

* Delete files with simple file specs like `c:\temp\*.*` or `*.tmp`
* Recursively delete files down the folder hierarchy (-r switch)
* Optionally delete empty folders (-f switch)
* Filter by files to delete based on days or seconds before current time (-d -s)
* Files can be optionally dumped into the Recycle Bin for recoverable deletes (-y)
* Preview mode lets you test run to see what would get deleted (-l)
* Works with deeply nested folder hierarchies (like NPM folders)
* Works around Windows MAX_PATH limitations
* Portable, single-file EXE file

### History

##### Version 1.12
*Mar. 25th, 2015*

* **Fix current Path Operation**<br/>
Fixed issue when running without an absolute path out of the current folder so that wildcards `*.tmp` and relative paths `temp\*.tmp` work out of the current folder.

* **Updated Messages**
Cleanup the output display messages with cleaner numbers to summarize results.

##### Version 1.11
*Feb. 28th, 2015*

* **Support for paths longer than MAX_PATH**<br/>
You can now delete deeply nested paths (such as nasty NPM hierarchies). Integrated with [ZetaLongPaths](https://github.com/UweKeim/ZetaLongPaths/) to provide long path support on all directory and file delete operations.

* **Delete ReadOnly, System and Hidden Files**<br/>
Previously read-only files wouldn't delete. This updates now deletes any kind of file regardless of attribute settings. Locked and access denied files still will not work, but everything else will delete.

* **Quiet Mode**<br/>
Add -q0..2 switch to allow quiet operation that runs without showing every file and folder deleted. -q0 shows all - q1 only shows summary, -q2 shows only startup banner.
