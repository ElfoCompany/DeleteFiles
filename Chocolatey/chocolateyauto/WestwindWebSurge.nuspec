		DeleteFiles is a small Windows command line utility that deletes nested file and folder hierarchies recursively and has support for deeply nested folder structures that typically make Windows Explorer choke (like deep NPM hierarchies). You can also optionally specify a time out for files to be deleted so you can delete files that are say 7 days old. Files can be hard deleted or sent to the recycle bin.
